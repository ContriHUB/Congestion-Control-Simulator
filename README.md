Simulates the congestion control algorithms in TCP: slow start and congestion avoidance using react.js

## Functionality:
1. User enters the value of ssthresh.
2. Before every packet transfer, user selects the future state of the packet as delivered or lost.
3. Based on the results of the algorithms, the sequence number of packets sent and the acknowledgements received per unit RTT will be displayed.
